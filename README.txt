The program code includes the solution for the finite element exercise for the NSSC 2 lecture. In the exercise a heat transfer is computed for different kind of meshes, based on section 6.
If one runs the code, then the heat flux, the temperature gradiant and the temperature field is returned and saved in the directory, where the file is placed.
Furthermore the stiffness matrix, the nodal temperature and the nodal force vector is returned with the python function print_HTP(H,T,P).
